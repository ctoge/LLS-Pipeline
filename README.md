# LLS-Pipeline
This repository contains the code / code history used for the pipeline for my thesis. This code was ran on the Unviersity of Georgia Sapelo2 HPC and batch scripts will be uploaded with personal information omitted.

## Workflow Synopsis
This workflow used two different pipelines. Using the [GATK4 Fungal Pipeline](https://github.com/broadinstitute/fungal-wdl/blob/master/gatk4/README.md) as well as a more hands on pipeline. That was kind of kit bashed togather based on what I found on forms.
